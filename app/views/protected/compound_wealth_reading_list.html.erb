PREFACE:

Looking at the stock market in recent years, there are selections of stocks for
which if the portfolio is rebalanced monthly to a constant proportion then over
about a decade, e.g. from Jan 1992 through Dec 2002, one's wealth would have
multipled 5462 fold!  Moreover, investing in only 4 particular stocks in this way
would have had a wealth factor of over 4000.  That is, $1000 invested in that
selection of stocks would have become over $4 million.  Other strategies with non-
constant portfolios would have had even higher return.  This leads us to ask basic
questions. How does one characterize the behavior of the market with hindsight?
By what factor less than the maximum wealth are realizable strategies that don't
have the advantage of hindsight.  Can one make guarantees (concerning this factor
of drop from the maximum) that hold for all possible price sequences?


COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course is a study in growth rate optimal investment.  We explore properties
of compounded wealth in repeated gambling and in stock market investment.  Wealth
concentration properties are explored and the strategies of highest concentrated
wealth are derived.  Normal theory is developed for log-wealth.  Relationships are
given to the principle of maximum likelihood in statistics.   Universal portfolios
and their relationships to Bayes methodology are also examined.  The ratio of
idealized wealth (best with hindsight) to actual wealth is studied both for
stochastic stock price sequences and its minimax behavior for arbitrary price
sequences.  Algorithms are developed for computation of universal portfolios.

We explore both the development of the theory, through mathematical analysis,
and the practice, through empirical study of its implications in stock markets.

This course is available to any students who have completed introductory
probability.  Some introductory statistics exposure is desirable but not
required.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

Students are expected to participate through discussion in class and by
giving a mid-October report and a late-November/early-December report.
The reports may cover aspects of either theory or practice related to the
material of the class.  At least one of the reports should have an oral
component of about 15-45 minutes presented to the class and there should
be at least one written report.  The mid-term report may present a preliminary
investigation expanded on in more depth in the final report.

Some of the core material is similar to what was covered last year in Statistics
676a ``Some Topics in Portfolio Selection.''  Students who took Stat 676a last
year are also permitted in 678a this year under the restriction that they report
on topics not addressed in the previous year.
