<h3>
Installation of Oracle 10g R2 [ 10.2.0.2 ]  on Solaris10x86
</h3>
<pre>

------------------------

This file contains some notes from my efforts to install 10gR2 [ 10.2.0.2 ] on Solaris10x86.

Frys
----
I went to Frys and bought a PC they call an open-box special.
It's a PC which is discounted because it has been returned
by another customer.

For about $500, I bought this:

HP Pavilion a1340n

It has 1G RAM,
250G HD,
1 R-W DVD drive
and 1 R-O DVD drive.
CPU: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.66GHz

</pre>
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=us&product=1818054&dlc=&docname=c00575715">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=us&product=1818054&dlc=&docname=c00575715</a>
<pre>

Warranty-wise, the PC was brand new and I was the original owner.
I considered it a good deal.

Also I bought a small Hyundai flat screen monitor for $179.

Windows
-------
The PC came with XP factory-installed.
Instead of supplying a DVD, HP put a backup of XP on the first partition.
Then, XP was layed out on the rest of my 250G hard-drive.
I figured out how to interact with the restore mechanism in case I 
clobbered XP.

The PC comes with a utility to backup the XP-backup to DVD.

The utility does not work.

It does work though if you choose to backup the XP-backup to CDR.

So, I backed up the XP-backup to 16 CDRs.

Linux
------
My HP PC does not like linux.

Fedora Core 5 installed but kernel panicked after I loaded
a CDR into either of the DVD trays.

Centos 4.4 kernel panicked during initial boot-off-cd.

Suse 10.1 died at different random places inside of Yast2.

I gave up on Linux.

During my Linux activities, I clobbered the 2nd disk partition
containing XP.

I recreated it to a much smaller size and walked through the 
XP restore gizmo found in the land of F10.

It worked great.

Now if I want to surf the information highway without a helmet,
I can boot XP and do it.


FreeBSD
-------
I installed FreeBSD 6.1 on the 3rd partition.
My HP PC likes FreeBSD and now, so do I.

The install was painless and unencumbered by
any documentation.  All I did was feed it 2 CDRs
and answer simple networking questions.

X-windows does not work on my FreeBSD console.

If however, I want to run X-windows on my FreeBSD
box and display it on my Mac, I can do that.

This is fine; I don't want a console cluttering my desk.

Unfortunately, Oracle does not run natively on FreeBSD.

( If you are clever enough it can be done by fooling
Oracle into thinking that it is running on Linux ).



Solaris 10 x86
---------------
While poking around on 

</pre>
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/index.html</a>
<pre>

I saw that on Sep 18 2006, 10gR2 had been released
for Solaris 10 X86.

So I went to sun.com and started a download.

It was just too big and my browser could not 
eat the whole thing.

So, I tried Sun Download Manager (SDM) on my Mac.

SDM is a Java app which means that I can't paste
a URL into its URL window.

My work-around was to use an editor to copy the
download URL into the SDM log file.

Then I used SDM to open the log file and then
grabbed the URL with a ^c of the mouse and
pasted it into the URL window with a ^v.

Eventually I pulled down 5 .iso files and
burned them to CDR using my Mac.

The installation was easy; feed CDRs; answer
simple networking questions.

Actually, the interface they provide to customize
the disk-layout was a little confusing.

I like the FreeBSD interface.

Anyway, I got it so it was like this:

root        10gb
export/home 80gb
swap        1gb

I should have made swap 2gb so that the Oracle
installer would not whine later.

During the install, Solaris seemed to recognize
my console enough to run X-windows on it.

It showed me some colored ellipses and recognized
that I clicked in the correct location during
X-window configuration time.

Eventually installation finished.

After the first multi-user boot, Solaris tried to
display an X login page on my console.

All I saw was a scramble of random color bits.

I tried to login using a terminal window on my mac.

I could not get into the root account.

So, I powercycled the PC.

Eventually, I got a login prompt at the console and I logged in
as root and added a UNIX user.

This allowed me to login and then su from my Mac
if I needed to get in later.

Next, I removed this file so my console would always
display a text login:

/etc/rc2.d/S99dtlogin

The only editor available was vi.

So, I added a couple of lines to 
/etd/dfs/dfstab

	share  -F nfs  /export/home
	share  -F nfs  /

Then I ran the above lines as shell commands.

I then had NFS access to my Solaris box.

This allowed me to use my favorite editor on my Mac
to edit files on my Solaris box.


Next, I edited the Grub menu so I could boot FreeBSD on the PC.

I edited this:

/boot/grub/menu.lst

I added this:

title FreeBSD 6.1
  root (hd0,2,a)
  kernel /boot/loader

The above entry corresponds to this disk layout:

0 -XP backup
1 -XP
2 -FreeBSD 6.1
3 -Solaris 10

Here is what I have now in /boot/grub/menu.lst :


title FreeBSD 6.1
  root (hd0,2,a)
  kernel /boot/loader

#---------- ADDED BY BOOTADM - DO NOT EDIT ----------
title Solaris 10 6/06 s10x_u2wos_09a X86
root (hd0,3,a)
kernel /platform/i86pc/multiboot
module /platform/i86pc/boot_archive
#---------------------END BOOTADM--------------------
#---------- ADDED BY BOOTADM - DO NOT EDIT ----------
title Solaris failsafe
root (hd0,3,a)
kernel /boot/multiboot kernel/unix -s
module /boot/x86.miniroot-safe
#---------------------END BOOTADM--------------------

title Windows
	rootnoverify (hd0,0)
	chainloader +1

title Windows
	rootnoverify (hd0,1)
	chainloader +1

This Grub layout will affect my PC so that FreeBSD 6.1
will boot by default since it is the first OS in the list.

At this point I had a good feeling about Solaris 10.
Linux will not install on my PC and Solaris 10 will install.
The Solaris x86 people at Sun.com should be proud.


To complete the install of Solaris 10 I ran this shell command:

ln -s /export/home /h

Which should save me some typing in the future.



Oracle 10gR2 [ 10.2.0.2 ] installation on Solaris 10 x86
----------------------------------------------------------

I downloaded the big .zip file from here:

</pre>
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/oracle10g/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/oracle10g/index.html</a>
<pre>

I unzipped it.

I created 2 groups:

dba
oinstall

I created the oracle user and listed it in the oinstall group entry.

I created a .bashrc for oracle:


# .bashrc

umask 022

export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:.:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/opt/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/etc:/usr/openwin/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib:/usr/dt/lib

export ORACLE_SID=orcl
export ORACLE_BASE=/h/oracle
export ORACLE_HOME=${ORACLE_BASE}/product/10r2

export NLS_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY/MM/DD:HH24:MI:SS
export NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P1

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${ORACLE_HOME}/lib
export PATH=${PATH}:${ORACLE_HOME}/bin

export TERM=vt100

# Nice bash shell prompt from google
export PS1='\s \h \u \w \# \$ '

# some aliases
alias ls='ls -CFa'
alias al=alias
alias d=date
alias cx='chmod +x'
alias grip='grep -i'
alias grp=grip
alias alg='alias|grp'
alias envg='env|grp'
alias ll='ls -l'
alias m=more
alias ltr='ls -latr'
alias psor='/bin/ps -ef |sort'
alias psorg='psor|grp'
alias dspmac='export DISPLAY=mac:0'

I looked at the installation guide.

I did this:


bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $  /usr/sbin/prtconf|grp mem
Memory size: 960 Megabytes
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $



bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $ /usr/sbin/swap -s
total: 104996k bytes allocated + 16720k reserved = 121716k used, 1644004k available
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $




bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $  df -k /tmp
Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
swap                 1642216      36 1642180     1%    /tmp
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $


Next, I bumped into something:



bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $ /bin/isainfo -kv
64-bit amd64 kernel modules
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $
bash sol oracle ~ $



I want this:

      32-bit i386 kernel modules

The oracle doc says,

"If you do not see the expected output, then you cannot install the software on this system."

Not good; I decided to press on and ignore this problem.


Next...
  /usr/sbin/patchadd -p | grep 118345
  /usr/sbin/patchadd -p | grep 119961

Passed.

Next,

As root, run this:

projmod -sK "project.max-shm-memory=(privileged, 2G,deny)" group.dba

That is WRONG!
It is an Oracle doc bug.

Google gave me this:

bash sol root / 6 # projmod -s -K "project.max-shm-memory=(priv,2gb,deny)" group.dba
bash sol root / 7 # cat /etc/project
system:0::::
user.root:1::::
noproject:2::::
default:3::::
group.staff:10::::
group.dba:100:Oracle default:::project.max-shm-memory=(priv,2147483648,deny)
bash sol root / 8 # 

then

shutdown -y -g0 -i6

to reboot.

Then,

bash sol oracle ~ 1 $ id -p
uid=1000(oracle) gid=100(dba) projid=100(group.dba)


Next, on the mac, start X windows.

Then,

ssh -X oracle@sol

cd cdrom/database
./runInstaller

It complains a lot then quits.


./runInstaller -ignoresysprereqs

Installer appears on my Mac but seems injured; it can't display stuff it
needs to and does not know where my mouse is.




I tried the silent install...


bash sol oracle ~/cdrom/database 21 $ ./runInstaller -force -ignoresysprereqs -silent -responseFile /h/oracle/cdrom/database/response/enterprise.rsp ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME ORACLE_HOME_NAME=OH1

So, I went to a root window and ran the shell scripts.

SQL*Plus: Release 10.2.0.2.0 - Production on Thu Sep 21 22:21:44 2006

Copyright (c) 1982, 2005, Oracle.  All Rights Reserved.


Connected to:
Oracle Database 10g Enterprise Edition Release 10.2.0.2.0 - Production
With the Partitioning, OLAP and Data Mining options

SQL> 
SQL> 




The SQL prompt does not lie.
It appears that I have just installed Oracle 10gR2 [ 10.2.0.2 ] on Solaris 10 x86.

I'm worried though.

During installation, the complaint about the kernel parameters is
worrisome; maybe it's an Oracle bug; maybe I need to investigate the
projmod command and Solaris 10 kernel parameters.

Next, I wanted to try out OEM dbconsole.

I tried the magic URL:

http://sol:1158/em/

I found nothing there.

I tried starting it with:

emctl start dbconsole

This time the URL sent an ugly
500 error to my browser.

I shutdown OEM:

emctl stop dbconsole

I checked the logfile:

bash sol oracle ~/product/10r2/sol_orcl/sysman/log 46 $ tail -44 emagent.trc

I see:

2006-09-22 22:06:41 Thread-63 ERROR engine: [oracle_database,orcl,Response] : 
nmeegd_GetMetricData failed : ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied (DBD ERROR: OCISessionBegin)

I tried sqlplus sysman/sysman

It gave me a ORA-01017

I did:

ALTER USER SYSMAN IDENTIFIED BY SYSMAN;

I did this:

cd  $ORACLE_HOME/host_sid/sysman/config
Backup the file emoms.properties
vi the file emoms.properties
Find the line beginning with:
oracle.sysman.eml.mntr.emdRepPwd=
Enter the un-encrypted password which is SYSMAN

Find this line
oracle.sysman.eml.mntr.emdRepPwdEncrypted=TRUE
Change TRUE by FALSE

Then,

bash sol oracle ~/product/10r2/sol_orcl/sysman/config 7 $ emctl start dbconsole

Then,

http://sol:1158/em/

It gave me a login screen.

I ran to a terminal and did this:

ALTER USER SYSTEM IDENTIFIED BY MGR;

I entered SYSTEM/MGR in the web page.

I logged in.

Next, I navigated to the 'Monitoring Configuration' link
at the bottom of the 'Database' page.
There, I specified the new password of the DBSNMP user
( which I had just changed with sqlplus ).

OEM now works as I expect.


Next, I started isqlplus:


bash sol oracle ~ 46 $ 
bash sol oracle ~ 46 $ 
bash sol oracle ~ 46 $ $ORACLE_HOME/bin/isqlplusctl start 

iSQL*Plus 10.2.0.2.0
Copyright (c) 2003, 2005, Oracle.  All Rights Reserved.
iSQL*Plus instance on port 5560 is already running ...
bash sol oracle ~ 47 $ 
bash sol oracle ~ 47 $ 

I tried the URL 

  http//sol:5560/isqlplus

It worked great.
